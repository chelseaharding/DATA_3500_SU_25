# checkpoint activity
# create two variables for your first name and last name
# and then concatenate them together into a variable called full_name
# create a variable that stores the string "awesome"
# multiple that variable by 20 so it is now 20 awesomes.
# concatenate your full_name, "is", and the new awesome variable
# and print to the console
