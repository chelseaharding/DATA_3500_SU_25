Programming Activities for Week6 ZoomSession 1

1. Write a function named "welcome_fctn" which takes one argument, called "name".  Inside the function, print to the console "Welcome " name.

- use the def command to define a function "welcome_fctn"

- add a parameter list with one variable "name", i.e. (name)

- print "Welcome " name in the function body.

- we dont need a return statement here, but keep in mind python does return nothing.

- call the function, welcome_fctn(<your_name>)

def welcome_fctn(name):
    print("Welcome",name)

welcome_fctn("andy")
